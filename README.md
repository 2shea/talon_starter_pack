# Talon Modules for use with [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/)

This collection of modules contains a starter pack of voice commands to be used with Talon, a hands-free input replacement. Modules for eye tracking with the Tobii 4C eye tracker are not included in this pack, but can be found in [Talon Community](https://github.com/dwiel/talon_community). 

Some modules were originally copied from [Talon Community](https://github.com/dwiel/talon_community).


# Prerequisites
- Install Talon
- Install Dragon (most commands may also work with the free built-in voice engine)
- Microphone (built in microphone won't produce great results, a good microphone makes a significant difference)

Follow the [Getting Started](https://talonvoice.com/docs/) section of the Talon docs.
